# ðŸ’€ Setup This Damn Project

## 1. Set Your Damn Environment
Copy that `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` â€” donâ€™t be lazy:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
````

## 2. Run It Like You Mean It

### If You Got a Makefile

You're lucky, just do this and shut up:

```bash
make up
```

### If You Donâ€™t Have a Makefile

Too bad, type this yourself, you lazy beast:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Now stop whining and get to work. ðŸ–•
